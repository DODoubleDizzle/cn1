# Port
**Role of Ports in TCP**: A port in TCP is a 16-bit number, which means the range of possible port numbers is from 0 to 65535. Ports are used to identify specific applications or services running on a networked device.
**How Ports Are Used**: When a device sends data over a network, it attaches the destination TCP port number to the data packet. This number tells the receiving device which application or service the packet is intended for. Similarly, the source port number is used to identify the application or service on the sending device.
**Well-Known Ports**: Ports 0 through 1023 are designated as well-known ports and are reserved for specific services. HTTP uses port 80,  HTTPS (HTTP Secure) uses port 443. Services like FTP 21, SSH 22, Telnet 23, SFTP 22.
**Registered Ports**: Ports 1024 to 49151 are known as registered ports, designated for specific purposes by various applications but not as strictly reserved as well-known ports.
**Ephemeral**:  Ports 49152 to 65535 are dynamic or private ports and can be used by any application for temporary connections.
**Socket**: A combination of an IP address and a port number is known as a socket. A socket thus uniquely identifies a specific endpoint of a network connection.
