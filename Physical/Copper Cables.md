# Copper Cables
Copper cables are widely used for networking and telecommunications due to their cost-effectiveness and reliability. The two main types are twisted pair and coaxial cables.

#### Twisted Pair Cables

- **Structure**: Consists of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together.
- **Types**:
    - **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)**: No additional shielding, more susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Common in Ethernet networks (CAT5, CAT6).
    - **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)**: Includes a foil shield to reduce EMI. Used in environments with high interference.
- **Categories**: Vary based on data transmission speed and bandwidth. For example, CAT5e supports up to 1 Gbps, while CAT6 supports up to 10 Gbps over short distances.
- **Applications**: Common in local area networks (LANs), telephone systems.

#### Coaxial Cables

- **Structure**: A single copper conductor at the center, surrounded by a plastic layer for insulation, a metallic foil or braided shield, and an outer plastic covering.
- **Types**:
    - **RG-6**: Used for cable television, internet, and other data transmissions.
    - **RG-59**: Commonly used for closed-circuit television (CCTV) applications.
- **Benefits**: Better shielding compared to twisted pair cables, making them less susceptible to EMI and suitable for longer distances.
- **Applications**: Broadband internet, cable television, Ethernet backbones.
