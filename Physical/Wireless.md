### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
SNR is a measure, representing the level of the desired signal relative to the background noise level. Higher SNR indicates a clearer signal. A low SNR might result in poor connection quality and slower speeds.

### Power Management
In wireless networking, managing the power consumption of devices is crucial, especially for mobile devices. Power management techniques include adjusting the transmission power, implementing sleep modes, and using power-efficient protocols. This ensures longer battery life while maintaining adequate network performance.
