# Overview
## Purpose
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.

## Layers
1. [[Physical Layer]]: Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables and switches.
2. [[Data Link Layer]]: Manages the node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction from the physical layer.
3. [[Network Layer]]: Handles data transfer between different networks and routing through the best path.
4. [[Transport Layer]]: Ensures complete data transfer and manages error detection and recovery.
5. **Session Layer**: Establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Transforms data into a format that the application layer can accept.
7. **Application Layer**: Provides network services directly to the user's applications.

## Significance
- Facilitates standardization and interoperability between different systems and technologies.
- Helps in troubleshooting by segregating network communication into manageable pieces.
- Provides a guideline for the creation and implementation of networking standards and devices.
