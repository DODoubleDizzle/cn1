## Collision Domain
Collision domains are spaces where frames can collide. These happen on directly connected, half duplex devices for example a bus. These domains get split by switches (layer 2) and routers (layer 3) creating a collision domain for each port
## Broadcast Domain
The broadcast domain is a space where a broadcast will reach, switches flood broadcasts through all ports but routers do not, so broadcast domains will be split by routers.
