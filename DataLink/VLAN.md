# VLAN
1. **Definition**: A VLAN is a logical subdivision of a local area network (LAN) that groups together a collection of devices from different physical LAN segments. VLANs allow network administrators to partition a single physical network into multiple virtual networks.
2. **Benefits**:
    - **Segmentation**: It improves network performance and traffic management by segregating large networks into smaller, more manageable segments.
    - **Security**: By segmenting the network, VLANs can increase security as devices on one VLAN cannot directly communicate with devices on another VLAN without proper routing.
    - **Flexibility**: VLANs provide the flexibility to group users by function rather than location. For instance, all members of a particular department can be on the same VLAN regardless of their physical locations in the building.
