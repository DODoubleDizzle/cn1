# Port Aggregation
Port Aggregation, also known as Link Aggregation, is a method used in computer networking to combine (aggregate) multiple network connections in parallel. This technique increases throughput and provides redundancy in case one of the links fails. 
1. **Purpose**: The primary goal of port aggregation is to increase the network capacity beyond the limits of any single network cable or port. It also enhances the reliability and availability of the network connection.
2. **How it Works**:
    - **Multiple Ports**: It involves combining two or more network connections (usually Ethernet) into a single logical link.
    - **Load Balancing**: The aggregated link can balance the traffic load across the individual links, which can increase the effective bandwidth.
    - **Redundancy**: If one of the physical links in the aggregation fails, traffic can continue to flow over the remaining links, reducing the risk of network downtime.
