# Solicited Node
A "Solicited Node" in IPv6 networking refers to a special type of multicast address that is used for efficient network traffic management, particularly for the Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP). 

**Calculation**: A Solicited Node multicast address is automatically generated for each IPv6 address assigned to a network interface. It is formed by combining the prefix `FF02::1:FF` with the last 24 bits (6 digits) of the corresponding IPv6 address. For instance, if a device has the IPv6 address `2001:db8::567:89ab`, the Solicited Node multicast address would be `FF02::1:FF67:89AB`.
**How It Works**: When an IPv6-enabled device needs to learn the MAC address of another device on the same network (for sending packets to it, for example), it sends a Neighbour Solicitation message to the Solicited Node multicast address corresponding to the target device's IPv6 address. This message asks the owner of that IPv6 address to respond with its link-layer address.
**Efficiency**: In IPv4, a similar process (ARP) broadcasts a request to all nodes on the local network, which can lead to inefficiencies, especially in large networks. IPv6 improves upon this by using Solicited Node addresses, which are a type of multicast address listened to only by specific nodes. This results in significantly less local network traffic.
**Scope**: Solicited Node multicast addresses have a link-local scope, meaning they are only relevant and used within the local network segment.
